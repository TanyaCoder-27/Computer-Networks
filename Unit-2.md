## **1. Multiplexing in Computer Networks**  

Multiplexing is a method used in networking and telecommunications to efficiently utilize the bandwidth of a transmission medium by combining multiple signals into a single channel. This technique improves network efficiency and optimizes resource usage. There are three primary types of multiplexing:

### **1.1 Frequency Division Multiplexing (FDM)**  
- **Concept:** FDM divides the available bandwidth into multiple frequency channels. Each signal is transmitted on a unique frequency, ensuring simultaneous data transmission without interference.  
- **Characteristics:**  
  - Signals occupy distinct frequency bands.  
  - Used for analog signal transmission.  
  - Requires frequency filters to separate signals at the receiving end.  
- **Applications:**  
  - Used in **radio and television broadcasting** for transmitting multiple channels.  
  - Found in **broadband communication systems** such as cable networks.  
  - Used in **cellular networks** where different frequency bands are assigned to various communication channels.  

### **1.2 Wavelength Division Multiplexing (WDM)**  
- **Concept:** WDM is similar to FDM but operates in the optical domain, where different wavelengths of light are used to transmit multiple signals through a single optical fiber.  
- **Characteristics:**  
  - Utilizes multiple light wavelengths for simultaneous data transmission.  
  - Primarily used for **fiber optic communications**.  
  - Supports **Dense WDM (DWDM)** and **Coarse WDM (CWDM)** for different bandwidth requirements.  
- **Applications:**  
  - Used in **fiber-optic networks** to increase data transmission capacity.  
  - Enables **high-speed internet services**.  
  - Used in **long-distance communication systems** like undersea cables.  

### **1.3 Time Division Multiplexing (TDM)**  
- **Concept:** TDM divides transmission time into fixed time slots assigned to each signal. Signals are transmitted sequentially, ensuring efficient bandwidth allocation for digital communication.  
- **Characteristics:**  
  - Each signal is allotted a **time slot** for transmission.  
  - Works well for **digital signals**.  
  - Requires synchronization at the receiving end.  
- **Applications:**  
  - Used in **telephony systems** (e.g., PSTN and ISDN).  
  - Found in **data communication networks** such as digital circuits in computer networks.

## **2. Transmission Media in Computer Networks**  

Transmission media are the pathways through which data signals travel between devices. They are broadly classified into **guided (wired) media** and **unguided (wireless) media**.

### **2.1 Guided Transmission Media (Wired)**  

#### **2.1.1 Twisted Pair Cable**  
- **Structure:** Consists of two insulated copper wires twisted together to minimize electromagnetic interference.  
- **Types:**

  - **Shielded Twisted Pair (STP)** â€“ has extra shielding to reduce noise.  
- **Applications:**  
  - Used in **telephone lines and DSL connections**.  
  - Common in **local area networks (LANs)**.  

#### **2.1.2 Coaxial Cable**  
- **Structure:** A copper conductor surrounded by insulating material and a metallic shield.  
- **Advantages:**  
  - **Better shielding** reduces interference.  
  - **Higher bandwidth** compared to twisted pair cables.  
- **Applications:**  
  - Used in **cable TV networks**.  
  - Used in **broadband internet connections**.  

#### **2.1.3 Optical Fiber**  
- **Structure:** Thin strands of glass or plastic transmitting data using light signals.  
- **Advantages:**  
  - **Extremely high bandwidth** for fast data transmission.  
  - **Immunity to electromagnetic interference**.  
- **Applications:**  
  - Used in **fiber-optic communication networks**.  
  - Found in **data centers and high-speed internet services**.  

### **2.2 Unguided Transmission Media (Wireless)**  

#### **2.2.1 Radio Waves**  
- **Characteristics:** Long-range signals used for broad coverage.  
- **Applications:** Used in **AM/FM radio broadcasting, satellite communication, and mobile networks**.  

#### **2.2.2 Microwaves**  
- **Characteristics:** High-frequency signals requiring line-of-sight transmission.  
- **Applications:** Used in **satellite communication, Wi-Fi, and point-to-point wireless networks**.  

#### **2.2.3 Infrared Transmission**  
- **Characteristics:** Short-range communication using infrared light signals.  
- **Applications:** Used in **remote controls, sensor-based systems, and short-range communication devices**.

## **3. Switching in Computer Networks**  

Switching is the process of directing data packets efficiently between a source and destination. There are three main types:

### **3.1 Circuit Switching**  
- **Concept:** Establishes a dedicated communication path before data transmission begins.  
- **Characteristics:**  
  - Provides a **fixed communication path** throughout the session.  
  - Ensures continuous real-time transmission.  
  - Less efficient for burst traffic.  
- **Applications:**  
  - Used in **traditional telephone networks** (e.g., PSTN).  
  - Found in **ISDN (Integrated Services Digital Network)**.  

### **3.2 Packet Switching**  
Divides data into small packets and transmits them independently. Each packet finds its way to the destination via dynamic routing.  

#### **3.2.1 Datagram Packet Switching**  
- **Concept:** Each packet is routed independently and may take different paths.  
- **Characteristics:**  
  - **Dynamic routing** ensures flexibility.  
  - **Packets may arrive out of order**.  
- **Applications:**  
  - Used in **UDP (User Datagram Protocol) for real-time applications** like VoIP and streaming.  

#### **3.2.2 Virtual Circuit Packet Switching**  
- **Concept:** Establishes a logical path before transmitting packets.  
- **Characteristics:**  
  - Ensures **packets arrive in order**.  
  - **Reliable but requires setup time**.  
- **Applications:**  
  - Used in **TCP-based applications like banking transactions and secure data transfer**.  

### **3.3 Message Switching**  
- **Concept:** Entire messages are stored at intermediate nodes before forwarding them sequentially.  
- **Characteristics:**  
  - **High delay but reliable message delivery**.  
  - No direct path between sender and receiver.  
- **Applications:**  
  - Used in **telegraphy and postal systems**.
