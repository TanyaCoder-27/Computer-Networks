# **Computer Networks (CN) Unit-1 Overview**

## **TCP/IP Protocol Suite**
The TCP/IP suite is the foundation of the modern internet, organizing communication into distinct layers.

### **1. Application Layer**
- **Functionality**:
  - Provides an interface for end-user applications to communicate with the network.
  - Supports services like file transfer, email, and web browsing.
  - Encodes and encrypts data if necessary.
  - Interacts with lower layers to facilitate communication between devices.
- **Examples**:
  - Browsing websites, transferring files, sending emails, and remote device access.

### **2. Transport Layer**
- **Functionality**:
  - Ensures end-to-end communication reliability and accuracy.
  - Provides flow control, ensuring one device doesnâ€™t overwhelm another with data.
  - Handles multiplexing/demultiplexing to allow multiple applications to share a single connection.
  - Manages error detection and correction during data transfer.
  - Protocols:
    - **TCP**: Offers reliable, connection-oriented data streams.
    - **UDP**: connectionless data transfers with lower overhead.
- **Examples**:
  - Streaming videos (UDP), downloading files (TCP), and online gaming (UDP).

### **3. Internet Layer**
- **Functionality**:
  - Handles addressing and routing of packets between devices across networks.
  - Breaks data into packets and ensures they travel efficiently to the destination.
  - Provides fragmentation and reassembly of data for large packets that exceed the network's maximum transmission unit.
  - Protocols:
    - **IP**: Establishes logical addresses (IPv4 or IPv6).
    - **ICMP**: Troubleshoots network connectivity and diagnoses issues.
    - **ARP**: Maps IP addresses to MAC addresses for local network communication.
    - **IGMP**: Manages group communications, enabling multicast data delivery.
- **Examples**:
  - Delivering emails, accessing websites, or pinging other devices.

### **4. Network Access Layer (Link Layer)**
- **Functionality**:
  - Deals with hardware-level communication, including data framing and physical transmission.
  - Ensures reliable data transfer over the physical medium (e.g., cables, Wi-Fi signals).
  - Defines how devices on the same network identify and communicate with one another.
  - Manages error detection at the physical level.
  - Protocols:
    - **Ethernet**: Standard for wired networks, providing MAC addressing and error checking.
    - **Wi-Fi**: Enables wireless communication.
    - **PPP**: Supports point-to-point connections, often used in internet dial-up services.
    - **Frame Relay**: Handles data transmission across wide area networks (WANs).
- **Examples**:
  - A computer connecting to a local router over Ethernet or Wi-Fi.
